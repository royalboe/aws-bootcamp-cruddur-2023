## Required Homework/Tasks

### Install and Verify AWS CLI 

I installed and verified AWS CLI on gitpod and on my local machine

For my local machine which is windows, I installed aws cli using **powershell**:
I ran the following commands
In order to prove that I am able to use the AWS CLI.
I am providing the instructions I used for my configuration of my local machine on windows.

I did the following steps to install AWS CLI.

I installed the AWS CLI for Windows 10 via command in **Command Prompt**:

I followed the instructions on the [AWS CLI Install Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

```PowerShell
msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi /qn
aws --version

I got this as a reponse

```powershell
C:\Users\Windows>aws --version
'aws' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
